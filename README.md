## Tutorial
You, dear player, attack enemies with either bullets or casts. They are the same color as your wand and subtract that color from any foe colliding with them. To destroy a foe you have to bring its color below a certain threshold. Unfortunately they can do the same to you in many ways. You can protect yourself with capes. They make you take less damage if the color is similar.  Any lost color can be restored after finding a heart.  Along the way you’ll find many capes, wands and hearts with different colors. Observe how they impact you and your enemies and choose the color that deals or blocks the most damage. Don’t be afraid to fail, learn and start over. It’s a rogue-like after all.
